Japan's APPI came into effect in May and with it came a "white list" of countries that provide adequate data protection similar to that of the EU. "The mutual recognition will add Japan to EU's white list and make the EU Japan's first 'white-listed' jurisdiction," Takase writes. "Even so, there remains a large number of differences between the privacy laws of the EU and Japan."

|Item|Japanese Act on Protection of Personal Information|GDPR|
|----|-------------------------------------------------|----|
|Purpose|To protect the rights and interests of individuals while ensuring due consideration for the usefulness of personal information by basic principles for the proper handling of personal information.|To enable the free movement of personal data within the Union while protecting fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to the protection of personal data.|
|Material Scope|Applies to the use of a personal information for business. The APPI has a very broad and open concept of data processing.|Applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means, within the scope of Union law.|
|Territorial Scope|The APPI does not have express provisions dealing with jurisdiction and territoriality.|Applies to processing that takes place in the Union or by a processor who has an establishment in the Union within the context of activities in the Union or to processing activities that are related to the offering of goods and services to (or behavioral monitoring of) data subjects in the Union.|
|Personal Data|“Personal Information” means the following two categories of information.Information about a living individual which can identify a specific individual by the description contained in the information, such as name, date of birth or other description (including voice or behavior information), including information which can easily be combined with other information so as to enable the identification of that individual; and Information that contains Personal Identifier Codes. “Personal Identifier Codes” means either (a) letters, numbers, marks or other codes for use with computers converted from a person’s bodily information which may identify the person, or (b) letters, numbers, marks or other codes on cards or other documents which are unique to the user or purchaser, and may identify the person. Apart from “Personal Information”, “Personal Data” is separately defined to cover information stored in a business operator’s database.Personal Data is defined as Personal Information constituting the business operator’s “Personal Information Database”. A “Personal Information Database” in turn is defined as: (i) an assembly of information systematically arranged in such a way that specific personal information can be retrieved by a computer; or (ii) an assembly of information in accordance with certain rules, and that has a table of contents, index or other means to facilitate the retrieval. Accordingly, once “Personal Information” is stored into a “Personal Information Database”, such Personal Information becomes “Personal Data” under the APPI. There are some provisions in the APPI that specifically deal with Personal Data.|Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.|
|Sensitive Personal|Personal Information that needs special care (“Sensitive Data”) is defined to include race, religion, social status medical history, criminal history and the fact that the person suffered damages by a crime.|Special categories of data that are considered particularly sensitive are personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual oriPersonal data shall be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.|entation.|
|Data Controller|There is no concept of a “Data Controller” under Japanese law. However, the APPI uses the term “business operator,” which essentially refers to the entity responsible for the proper handling of all “Personal Information.” This is similar to the concept of data controller under EU law.|Means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body, which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.|
|Data Processor|There is no concept of a “Data Processor” under Japanese law. As such, handling of personal data under the APPI should pertain to how a “business operator” treats and manages the personal information or personal data in its possession.|Means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.|
|Purpose Limitation|A business operator handling personal information shall not handle personal information beyond the scope necessary for achieving the purpose of use unless the business operator has obtained prior consent of data subjects. Purpose of use must promptly be notified to data subjects or publicly announced once a business operator acquires Personal Information, unless the purpose of use has already publicly announced.|Personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.|
|Accuracy|A business operator handling personal information must endeavor to keep the content of personal data accurate and up to date, within the scope necessary for achieving the purpose of use.|Personal data should be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, is erased or rectified without delay. Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.|
